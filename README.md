ExitApp
The Top of the Script (the Auto-execute Section)
After the script has been loaded, it begins executing at the top line, continuing until a Return, Exit, hotkey/hotstring label, or the physical end of the script is encountered (whichever comes first). 
This top portion of the script is referred to as the auto-execute section.
